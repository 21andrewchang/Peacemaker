# Peacemaker

In the village, realworld crimes of all severity are
generalized to littering. If a villager litters, their social credit
will automatically be dropped by 1 point.

Tax evasion will lower social credit by 1 point.

Donations increase social credit 1 point per 10 credits donated.

10 "days" per cycle.
1 cycle = 1 year in real time.

**Peacemaker Algorithm**

This algorithm learns to optimize the village's performance by
learning how much to tax each person. The parameters it takes into
account are the social credit of the person, economic class, etc.

**Representing Village Performance**

Taxes and donations payed by the villagers will go towards
"village performance" which will be represented by the "level"
of the village (numerical number).

At higher village levels, litter gets cleaned off the
floor more frequently to visually represent a more developed village.

Accumulated trash will decrease a villages level.

**Goal**

Run alongside a village with regular tax laws, and see which village
has more crime
